        Hi! My name is Himanshu Jain. I am a rising Junior at Duke University,
        North Carolina studying Electrical & Computer Engineering-Computer
        Science. I am also planning to complete a minor in Financial Economics.
        My home town is New Delhi, India but I currently live in Durham, North
        Carolina. I have deep interest in applying Computer Science in other
        fields like Finance and Health. For almost a year, I worked on an
        Android Application named Digital Fidget. I have also worked on a bot
        for excavating and mapping archaeological sites. Please head over to my
        Portfolio page for more information. I am a fitness enthusiast and I
        love to hit the gym in my freetime. I also play sports like Tennis and
        Basketball (Let's go Devils!).
